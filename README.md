# **# Learn MERN stack by building real-world applications with Node, Express, MongoDB, React and integrating RESTful APIs.**
### Do you want to build fast and powerful full-stack applications with JavaScript? Would you like to become a more complete and in-demand developer?
## Then MENR stack is the hottest technology for you to learn right now, and you came to the right place to do it!
### `_This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth full-stack application. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional project. We will dive deep into Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, React hooks, integrating RESTful APIs . Here is some of what you will learn in this course and project:_`
* How Nodejs work

_Web development is evolving, in the past, server-side rendering handled all views and templates, but with the emergence of frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, projects are now divided into backend and frontend components. The backend manages database interactions and serves JSON, while the frontend fetches data and creates the user interface. This course focuses on the entire full-stack aspect, enabling you to construct robust APIs and integrating RESTful APIs with React project._

_Our curriculum goes beyond typical Nodejs, Express and React tutorials, as we cover advanced topics like authentication, multi-user roles, permissions, password reset mechanisms, sending email integration, integrating RESTful APIs with React and many more. By the end of this course, you'll have a deep understanding of what it takes to be a proficient full-stack engineer._
